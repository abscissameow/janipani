book.There's a cut right at the base of this tree. Why would someone cut down a tree? To make a book out of it! Imagine living in the old days when you'd have to cut down a tree yourself to write or read a book.
bow.This radical looks like a fancy composite bow people would use to shoot at targets and definitely not any normal living animals. See how the middle part is being pulled back? Imagine holding this bow and firing it at a target shaped like a giant alligator-crab monster.
child.This radical is made up of two barbs and one ground radical. If there are barbs on the ground, whom (especially) do you want to avoid that area? You want your child to avoid it, since children are so careless and often don't wear shoes. Imagine how bad you'd feel if you let a child walk around on top of these barbs! Pretty bad, I imagine.
